		<!-- Max's Story -->
		<div class="col-md-10 col-lg-8 m-auto">
            <h6 class="title mb-4">Max's Story: The Seed of Inspiration</h6>
            <p class="mb-5">In the heart of a children's home in Beitou, there was a young 
            child who had experienced life's hardships from the very start. His mother was 
            sentenced to seven years in prison shortly after his birth, leaving him to navigate 
            the world with only the memory of her love. But despite his longing, his mother 
            never reached out, and this absence created a void that seemed insurmountable.</p>
            
            <p class="mb-5">Yet, within the walls of the children's home, Max found moments 
            of happiness. Building colorful Lego masterpieces became his refugeâ€”a place where 
            love and connection knew no boundaries. While other children went home to their 
            families during holidays, he remained, creating a world of imagination and creativity 
            with the tiny bricks.</p>

			<p class="mb-5">Max shared the children's home with his two brothers and one sister. 
			Although they offered occasional visits, their past experiences of living with 
			their mother softened the blow of her absence. For Max, however, the yearning 
			for a mother's love and understanding only grew stronger.</p>

			<h1>Problem Statement</h1>
			<br></br>
            <h6 class="title mb-4">Inadequate Care and Support for Children of Incarcerated Parents in Taiwan</h6>
            <p class="mb-5">In Taiwan, current legislation and practices for children of 
            incarcerated mothers pose significant challenges to their well-being and development. 
            According to statistics from the Ministry of Justice's Correctional Agency in November 
            106 (2017), there are 40 children under the age of 3 residing in correctional 
            institutions with their incarcerated mothers.</p>
            
            <p class="mb-5">These children face several critical issues during their stay 
            in prison. At night, they are confined together with their mothers and other 
            adult inmates in shared cells, lacking dedicated facilities for their specific 
            needs. Moreover, during the daytime, the children must accompany their mothers 
            to work in the prison's factories, forcing the mothers to juggle the responsibilities 
            of parenting and labor duties.</p>

			<p class="mb-5">The shortage of correctional officers in Taiwan's correctional 
			facilities further exacerbates the situation. With a staff-to-inmate ratio of 
			1:11, correctional officers struggle to provide adequate supervision and care 
			for both the adult inmates and the young children in their custody.</p>
			
			<p class="mb-5">Furthermore, the guidelines for allowing incarcerated individuals 
			to return home for visits create limited opportunities for children to maintain 
			meaningful connections with their incarcerated mothers. The infrequency of visitation, 
			determined by the length of the sentence, imposes emotional strain on both mothers 
			and children, hindering their ability to bond and offer each other the necessary 
			support.</p>
			
			<!-- ------ -->
			<br></br>
            <h6 class="title mb-4">The Need for Change: Enhancing the Lives of Children of Incarcerated Mothers</h6>
            <p class="mb-5">The current system fails to provide an environment conducive 
            to the healthy development and emotional well-being of children living in 
            correctional institutions with their mothers. The absence of dedicated 
            facilities and appropriate care arrangements for these young souls leads to 
            potential risks to their physical safety and emotional stability.</p>
            
            <p class="mb-5">To create a brighter future for these children and empower 
            them to break the cycle of incarceration, it is imperative to address the 
            following key issues:</p>

			<p class="mb-5">   1. <strong>Child-Friendly Facilities:</strong> The establishment 
			of dedicated spaces within correctional institutions, designed to cater to the 
			specific needs of children, is crucial. These facilities should ensure a safe, 
			nurturing environment that encourages learning, creativity, and healthy social 
			interactions.</p>
			
			<p class="mb-5">   2. <strong>Comprehensive Support:</strong> A comprehensive 
			support system should be in place to assist incarcerated mothers in balancing 
			their roles as parents and inmates. This includes access to parenting education, 
			mental health counseling, and assistance with childcare responsibilities during 
			work hours.</p>
			
			<p class="mb-5">   3. <strong>Increased Staffing:</strong> Addressing the severe 
			shortage of correctional officers is vital to ensure the safety and well-being 
			of both adult inmates and their children. Adequate staffing ratios will enable 
			officers to provide personalized care and attention to those in their charge.</p>
			
			<p class="mb-5">   4. <strong>More Frequent Visitation:</strong> Facilitating 
			more frequent and extended visitations between children and their incarcerated 
			mothers is essential for maintaining strong family bonds and supporting the 
			children's emotional development.</p>
